# Final Assignment

The culminating project for Foundations of R will be the creation of an original analysis and data narrative. Your project will consist of several parts:

-   Selection of a dataset and development of a business question
-   Conducting an exploratory data analysis
-   Creation of a final repository and markdown document

## Selection of a dataset and development of a business question

You will propose a business question that you would like to answer and provide a dataset (or multiple datasets) that will help you to answer the question. You will create a short proposal for your project that will be due in the 4th week of class. This proposal will consist of a brief description of the problem you intend to solve and the dataset(s) that you intend to analyze in order to solve the problem.

You may select any dataset for your project. Here are a few interesting places that you might look to identify a dataset:

-   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
-   [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)
-   [data.world](https://data.world/)
-   [Delaware's Open Data Portal](https://data.delaware.gov/) (or any other state / municipality open data portal)
-   [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

In addition, you are allowed to use data from your work for this project. Please note that your final project will be published publicly, so you must receive appropriate permissions for doing so. Your data may be ingested from any format that you like. This may include .csv files, APIs, or web scraping. Your project must demonstrate provenance of the data from its original source through to the final report.

## Conducting an exploratory data analysis

After selecting your dataset, you will conduct an exploratory analysis. This exploratory data analysis will demonstrate how a data analyst or data scientist would begin to understand their raw dataset. You will determine counts, missingness, summary statistics, and distributions for all fields in the dataset depending upon the appropriate treatment of each field. Where appropriate, you will perform bivariate analyses of fields as well. You should provide interpretations of any visualizations produced from your exploratory data analysis. Your exploratory data analysis will be included in the final repository for your project as an RMarkdown file.

## Creation of a final repository and markdown document

You will create a repository on your personal GitHub for your analysis. You should add @rharrington31 as a collaborator on this repository. This repository should include all files, appropriately organized, for another analyst to be able to run all scripts necessary for the project on their local machine. Minimally, this should include:

- Exploratory data analysis RMarkdown file
- Final data narrative RMarkdown file
- Knitted data narrative HTML file
- .gitignore files
- README.md file
- .Rproj file

Additional files that you may include are:

- A script including any functions that you created
- Separate data ingestion script(s)
- A folder containing your data and appropriate files

Your repository should be turned into a [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) project such that your final data narrative can be accessed at a URL similar to `<your_github_username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>.

Your final data narrative, created as both a RMarkdown file and a knitted HTML file, should include the following information:

- An introduction that discusses the question you are answering and why it is important.
- A minimum of 5 publication quality visualizations that offer insight into the problem. Each visualization should include an interpretation
- A conclusion that outlines the answer to your question and offers evidence from your analysis to support it.
- Proposed next steps for further research questions you would consider based upon the results of your analysis.

## Project Submission
